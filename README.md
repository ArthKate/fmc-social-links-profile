### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .wrapper {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    background-color: var(--bg-Off-Black);
  }

  .profile-container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    background-color: var(--bg-Dark-Grey);
    width: 400px;
    height: 650px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Am yet to gasp using CSS grid and using locally hosted font-files. I did give a shot to both of these but am yet to understand them full. Doing to do more research and attempt pulling off a project using these skills.
